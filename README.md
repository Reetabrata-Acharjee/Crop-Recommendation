# Crop-Recommendation
A machine learning-based web application that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on environmental factors.

# Overview
This project uses a trained Random Forest Classifier model to predict the best crop to grow based on input parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. The model is trained on a dataset of crop yields and environmental factors, and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

#Features
* User-friendly interface for inputting environmental parameters
* Real-time crop recommendations based on input parameters
* Supports 22 different crops, including Rice, Maize, Jute, Cotton, and more
* Uses a trained machine learning model for accurate predictions.

# Requirements
* Python 3
* Streamlit
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Pickle

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to improve the model, add new features, or fix bugs, please submit a pull request.
